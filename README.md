# LeetCode Solutions in Python

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by problem category, difficulty, and study plans. The goal is to regularly solve problems to improve my coding skills, with a primary focus on Python. Each solution includes the problem description, time and space complexity analysis, and test cases.

**Repository Structure**:

- `individual_problems/`: Solutions to individual LeetCode problems, categorized by topics such as arrays, dynamic programming, graphs, and more. Each problem is further organized by difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).

- `study_plans/`: Solutions organized by study plans such as LeetCodeâ€™s 14-day Algorithm Challenge, 75 Blind Coding Challenge, and other structured learning paths. Problems are arranged by day or week according to the study plan.

**Key Features**:

- Python-based solutions with comments explaining the approach and complexity.
- Organized directory structure for easy navigation between problems and study plans.
- Test cases included for each solution to ensure correctness.
- Regular updates as I continue solving more problems and following different study plans.
